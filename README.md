# linguaspark

## Manual Testing

1. Install dependencies and run the app:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run lingua.py
   ```

2. Start a chat and send at least two messages.
3. The assistant's reply should reference earlier messages. The app sends the
   **full conversation history** with every request.
